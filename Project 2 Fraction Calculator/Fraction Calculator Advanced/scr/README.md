# Project Description

### Module 2 Project - Fraction Calculator Advanced

Create another class called FractionCalculatorAdvanced. You may cut and paste useful methods from FractionCalculator. The key difference between FractionCalculator and FractionCalculatorAdvanced is that the user can enter in their operations on a single line. Allow the user to enter their input onto a single line. Your program must be robust so that if the user enters in invalid input, it will re-prompt them until they either enter a q to quit or a valid operation. It is possible to do this without try/catch, but it is quite difficult. You may read about try/catch blocks here: http://beginnersbook.com/2013/04/try-catch-in-java/. Here is sample output from a run of FractionCalculatorAdvanced:
